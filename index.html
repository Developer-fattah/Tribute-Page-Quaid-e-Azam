                <b>Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah</b> (/ˈɑːli ˈdʒɪnɑː/; born Mahomedali
                Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948) was a barrister,
                politician, and the founder of Pakistan. He served as the leader of
                the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until Pakistan's creation on
                14 August 1947, and then as Pakistan's first Governor-General until
                his death. He is revered in Pakistan as Quaid-e-Azam ("Great
                Leader") and Baba-e-Qaum ("Father of the Nation"). Born in Karachi
                (then part of British India), Jinnah studied law in London and
                became a prominent lawyer in Bombay. He initially advocated for
                Hindu-Muslim unity and was a member of the Indian National Congress,
                but later became the leading voice for the Two-Nation Theory, which
                argued for a separate Muslim state in the subcontinent. His
                leadership during the Pakistan Movement culminated in the creation
                of Pakistan, an independent nation for Muslims. Jinnah's legacy as a
                statesman, constitutionalist, and advocate for democracy and
                religious freedom remains central to Pakistan's identity.
